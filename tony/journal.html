                Segway 1
    
                My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    
                cellphone
                iPod
                digital camera
                and a protein bar
                Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.

                Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    
                Walla Walla, WA
    
                Magic City, ID
                
                Bountiful, UT
    
                Last Chance, CO
                Truth or Consequences, NM
                Why, AZ

                I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
    
                Passing cars,
                When you can't see,
                May get you,
                A glimpse,
                Of eternity.
                I definitely won't be passing any cars.
